# MYPLTW-Algorithms-in-Python
Contains all works by Kaushik Rajarathinam for each section.

####### Meant for student at Foothill HighSchool | Computer Science Class

## Usage:
In the book, each section goes like '1.3.0',1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc..
So each file in this repositry will be labled based on it section. _(except the '.' are replaced with '-')_

All you will need to do is copy and paste the code I have and use it.

## Plagirism:
To avoid plagirism, try modifying my code into the format of the way you code.
ALL WORKS ARE FREE HERE. If your teacher catches you, this is not my fault, but yours, for you are the one 
who didn't listen to this one sectence.

## Narrative:
```
print("Hello User")
# prints the function hello user
```
I rarely narrate my code or illustrate on how it functions, but occasionally, you may find these comments in ``# format``
